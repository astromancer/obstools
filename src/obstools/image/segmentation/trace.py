    Radial pixel sweep / Moore's neighbour trace

    Parameters
    ----------
    b: array
        Binary image array
    stop: int
        Emergency stop criterion. Algorithm will terminate after this many
        pixels have been searched and the starting pixel has not yet been
        reached.  This is used mostly for debugging / instruction purposes.
        You can safely ignore this argument unless your segments are very
        very large.

    Returns
    -------
    pixels: array (n, 2)
        indices of pixels that make up the object boundary
    boundary: array (m, 2)
        The boundary outline of the object composed of pixel edges
    perimeter: float
        measurement of the object perimeter distance (circumference)
